# Multivariate_Chebyshev_Polynomials

This repository contains two MATLAB functions (ChebPoly_primal.m and ChebPoly_dual.m) designed to compute multivariate Chebyshev polynomials, together with their associated signatures, as described in the paper <i>Optimization-Aided Construction of Multivariate Chebyshev Polynomials</i> by M. Dressler, S. Foucart, E. de Klerk, M. Joldes, J. B. Lasserre, and Y. Xu. 
Both these functions require GloptiPoly 3 to be executed.

There are also two reproducible files: verifications.m runs these functions on some known examples to verify their correctness and discoveries.m runs them on unknown examples to construct the tables provided in the paper.
